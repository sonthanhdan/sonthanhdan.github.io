Small project using html and uikit build a static web. Thank to uikit css.

### Getting Started
Clone the repository
```shell

git clone https://github.com/sonthanhdan/sonthanhdan.github.io.git <username>.github.io

```
Start the static web server. From ***npm@5.2.0***, npm started installing a new binary alongside the usual npm called npx. So now, one liners to create static http server from current directory:
```sh
npx serve

# or

npx http-server

```
